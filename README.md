# hotel_booking

## Description

Building a complete hotel app in Django with advanced filters and booking options is an excellent project for Django learners. 

The app is modeled after India's largest hotel provider, OYO, and contains advanced logic for hotel reservation projects. 

The project utilizes advanced Django features such as filtering, foreign key relationships, and many-to-many relationships. By following this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Django's advanced features, making it a valuable resource for building customized hotel apps.
